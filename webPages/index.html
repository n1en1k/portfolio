Welcome to my portfolio!

Here I have some examples of my coding.

Web Design portfolio is easier to check on:
www.lankamaa.fi/niko
but I have the same images here, on webPages directory.
I don't want to share their code, so instead I have two other web layouts for that (to check structures and how I comment stuff etc).

If you wish to see how I used the codeblog layout in practice, please check it in here:
