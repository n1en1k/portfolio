### :man_technologist: About Me:

- :person_in_tuxedo: I am a hardworking, long-term and reliable employee. I work accurately and quickly without compromising on quality.

- :desktop_computer: I am interested in computer & peripheral repairs and sales, IT-support and full stack web development (LAMP stack [Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP], HTML and CSS on junior level and JavaScript on beginner level). I also like Python. I'm currently learning MERN stack and Laravel.

- :camera: In my spare time I listen operas, play the guitar and cook BBQ. I also enjoy photography.







Here I have some examples of my coding.

Web Design portfolio is easier to check on:
www.lankamaa.fi/niko
but I have the same images here, on webPages directory.
I don't want to share their code, so instead I have two other web layouts for that (to check structures and how I comment stuff etc).

Please check my other public repos as well!
